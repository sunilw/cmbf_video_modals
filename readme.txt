This plugin creates a custom post type called 'videos'.
Once the plugin is enabled you can add youtube videos. You select a
name and a cover image for your video. 

Add the iframe embed code.

----

Shorcode:
[publish_modals]

This will publish two things: a visible gallery of your cover
images. And an invisible div containing our modals.

Also, you get access to a minimal stylesheet for the modals.

----

When the plugin is active and you have created videos...

... you will be able to click video covers and have a modal containing
the video pop up.

todo

Many, many things.
