This plugin creates a custom post type called 'videos'.
Once the plugin is enabled you can add youtube videos. You select a
name and a cover image for your video. 

Add the iframe embed code.

----

Add a mechanism for inserting the code with a page or post.
A shortcode is probably best.

----

When the plugin is active and you have created videos...

... you will be able to click video covers and have a modal containing
the video pop up.
